Hi. This is the qmail-send program at example.com.
I tried to deliver a bounce message to this address, but the bounce bounced!

<jan.lobo@mari-el.ru>:
77.40.0.46 does not like recipient.
Remote host said: 550 5.1.1 <jan.lobo@mari-el.ru>: Recipient address rejected: User unknown in local recipient table
Giving up on 77.40.0.46.

--- Below this line is the original bounce.

Hi. This is the qmail-send program at example.com.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<sfoywlkyykul@example.net>:
Sorry, no mailbox here by that name. (#5.1.1)

--- Below this line is a copy of the message.
