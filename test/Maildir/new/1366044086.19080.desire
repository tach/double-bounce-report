Hi. This is the qmail-send program at example.com.
I tried to deliver a bounce message to this address, but the bounce bounced!

Giving up on 217.22.224.65.

Hi. This is the qmail-send program at example.com.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<info@example.net>:
Sorry, no mailbox here by that name. (#5.1.1)

Wonderful information for LB_T G - Liberty Coal - that will produce 
huge returns!!!

Acquisition plans are heating up that will drive LB_T G prices up to 
the $.20 - $.30 range. Today LB_T G is selling for pennies, so the 
money to be made is huge! Other companies want to acquire LB_T G 
because of their seemingly unlimited coal assets that can produce 
shale oil. Take action now to make money on this acquisition ahead 
of other investors. Buy every share of LB_T G you can possibly get 
on Apr, 15th!!!
