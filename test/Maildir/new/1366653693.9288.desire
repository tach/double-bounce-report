Hi. This is the qmail-send program at example.com.
I tried to deliver a bounce message to this address, but the bounce bounced!

<husvhfy@ablab.com>:
207.155.249.116 does not like recipient.
Remote host said: 550 <husvhfy@ablab.com>: Recipient address rejected: No such user [18NAUNJTTD00]
Giving up on 207.155.249.116.
