Hi. This is the qmail-send program at example.com.
I tried to deliver a bounce message to this address, but the bounce bounced!

<cjsfae@astravan.com>:

Remote host said: 554 5.7.1 <cjsfae@astravan.com>: Recipient address rejected: Access denied
Giving up on 66.39.2.48.

Sorry, no mailbox here by that name. (#5.1.1)
